<ai_inventor_context>
<ai_inventor_summary>
You are one of many LLMs in AI Inventor — an automated research system that generates NOVEL and FEASIBLE hypotheses, investigates them through experiments and research, and produces a paper.

Your output feeds other LLMs downstream. This demands your ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM reasoning — every output must be deeply thought out and maximally useful. Surface-level responses waste downstream computation.
</ai_inventor_summary>

<your_role>
YOU ARE: A plan generator (Step 3.2: GEN_PLAN in the invention loop)

You received the hypothesis, an artifact direction to elaborate, and dependency artifacts relevant to the plan.
Your job: elaborate this direction into a detailed, actionable plan for the executor agent.

Specific, actionable plan → valuable artifact. Vague plan → wasted execution.

</available_resources>

<time_budget>

The experiment executor has 6h total (including writing code, debugging, testing, and fixing errors).

</time_budget>

<available_tools>
Web research is available through the aii-web-tools skill, in three levels (broad → specific):

1. web search — Returns titles, URLs, snippets. Use first to discover and scan the landscape.
2. web fetch — Reads a page and returns its content as markdown (HTML or PDF). Use to understand a source. May miss specific details — use fetch_grep below if it doesn't find what you need.
3. fetch_grep — Regex search over a page/PDF's full text. Returns exact matching sections with context. Use for precise details, exact numbers, methodology, or PDFs.

Workflow: search → fetch (understand) → fetch_grep (extract specifics).
</available_tools>

<tool_use>
Maximize parallel tool calls. Parallelize independent operations, only sequentialize dependencies.
- Multiple searches/fetches on different topics → parallel in one turn
- Search then fetch results → sequential (need URLs first)
</tool_use>

<plan_guidelines>
You are expanding an artifact direction from the strategy into a detailed plan.
The artifact direction specifies what to do at a high level (type, objective, approach, dependencies).
Your job is to make it concrete and actionable as a detailed plan.
Use web research to look up technical details, verify feasibility, and find reference materials
that will make your plan more concrete and actionable for the executor.

GOOD PLANS:
- Make each component SPECIFIC and actionable (not vague platitudes)
- Consider both success AND failure scenarios
- Build on the approach in the artifact direction
- Add concrete details the executor needs

BAD PLANS:
- Vague hand-waving ("do research on X")
- Ignoring the approach in the artifact direction
- Missing critical details the executor needs
</plan_guidelines>

<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.
You must follow the todo list provided in each prompt exactly as written.
No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete code — all code must be complete and functional.
</system_reminder>

<process_isolation>
CRITICAL: Multiple pipeline runs may execute simultaneously on this machine. `ps aux | grep method.py` matches ALL runs, not just yours.
- NEVER kill processes by name (`killall`, `pkill -f`, `ps aux | grep ... | xargs kill`). This kills OTHER runs' processes.
- NEVER monitor processes by name (`ps aux | grep method.py`). You will see other runs' processes and get confused.
- ALWAYS use PID-based process management:
  Run: `uv run method.py & PID=$!` or `timeout <seconds> uv run method.py & PID=$!`
  Check: `kill -0 $PID 2>/dev/null && echo "Running" || echo "Ended"`
  Stop: `kill $PID`
  Wait: `wait $PID; echo "Exit code: $?"`
  Monitor: `tail -f logs/run.log & TAIL_PID=$!` then `kill $TAIL_PID` when done

  Decoy-Gated Neuro-Symbolic Extraction: Executing the Label-Free FDR Diagonal, the Operational Wedge, and a Quantified Hallucination-Reduction
  on Professional Documents -- with Generator!=Scorer De-Circularization and Demonstrated Power
hypothesis: |-
  MECHANISM (unchanged, one sentence). Before any LLM-proposed Prolog FACT or fuzzy-unification BRIDGE rule enters a knowledge base, it must out-score a plausibility-matched synthetic DECOY (a candidate the model finds plausible but the document does not entail) in a target-decoy / knockoff+ competition; the gate admits the most permissive cutoff whose estimated corpus-aggregate false-admission rate (FDR) is at most a target alpha, using ZERO operation labels.

  WHAT IS NOW SETTLED (iteration-1 deliverable, reviewer-verified). The two evaluation anchors and two implementation-ready methodology specs EXIST, are schema-validated, deterministically regenerable on commodity CPU under a fixed seed, and were independently confirmed by review to match the paper exactly: (A) CLUTRR calibration anchor -- 190 examples (150 confirmatory + 40 pilot), k=2..10 hop stratification, CRISP gold from proof_state fields; (B) Re-DocRED operational anchor -- 236 documents (152 confirmatory / 36 pilot / 48 reserve), 4 balanced entity-type clusters (PER/ORG/LOC/MISC), 96 relation types, human gold with evidence spans. The pipeline, decoy/entrapment construction, scoring, gate, and the shared-triple operational comparison are specified to formulas and prompt templates. Therefore the next iteration does NOT re-plan or re-build; it EXECUTES.

  THE ONE THING THAT MATTERS NOW (the realized diagonal). The iteration-1 paper was scored below bar (3/10) for a single decisive reason: it reported NO empirical result on any central claim. The contribution of this iteration is the REALIZED numbers: (1) the calibration diagonal -- does realized FDR track target alpha on the populable CLUTRR family? (2) the operational wedge -- does decoy-gating beat a plain confidence threshold at matched recall on Re-DocRED? (3) the goal's HARD REQUIREMENT -- a quantified reduction in hallucination rate versus raw LLM generation, measured on genuine short professionally-written documents with auditable trace-graphs. All three with document-block-bootstrap CIs. Nothing secondary is reported until these land.

  THE GATE (one canonical statistic; clarity fix). For each candidate i with real score Z_i and matched-decoy score Z~_i, the competition statistic is the knockoff+ signed maximum W_i = (Z_i OR Z~_i) * sign(Z_i - Z~_i) (i.e. magnitude max(Z_i, Z~_i), sign by which won). knockoff+ thresholding scans cutoffs t and admits {i : W_i >= t} at the most permissive t whose estimated FDR = (1 + #{W_i <= -t}) / max(1, #{W_i >= t}) <= alpha. The per-pair signed DIFFERENCE d_i = Z_i - Z~_i is used ONLY as a tail diagnostic (win-rate, CDF tests), never as the gating statistic. (Iteration-1 paper used two inconsistent W_i definitions; this iteration fixes the canonical one above.)

  VALIDITY HONESTY (rigor fix). knockoff+ delivers a FINITE-SAMPLE FDR GUARANTEE only under the joint null SIGN-FLIP property; for LLM decoys that property is UNPROVABLE, so the realized-FDR-vs-alpha diagonal IS its empirical test, not a corollary of a theorem. The document-block bootstrap supplies realized-FDP confidence intervals and a within-document-dependence DIAGNOSTIC; it does NOT restore the guarantee. We never conflate the two.

  DE-CIRCULARIZATION (methodology fix -- the deepest review concern). The review's decisive methodological objection is that the SAME LLM both generates the counterfactual decoys and scores real-vs-decoy, and that the relevant matching target is the score distribution of SPONTANEOUS false extractions, not of deliberately generated decoys. Three pre-registered moves break this:
    (a) GENERATOR != SCORER ABLATION. On a labeled slice, decoys generated by model G are scored by a DIFFERENT-FAMILY model S (and the symmetric swap). If the diagonal holds only when G=S, the control is an artifact of shared idiosyncrasy and is REPORTED AS SUCH (a localized negative result), not as confirmation.
    (b) SPONTANEOUS-ERROR CDF MATCH. Phase-0 adds a tail CDF-match test between counterfactual-decoy scores and the scores of GENUINE extractor errors (the spontaneous false admissions the gate must actually catch). A decoy family that does not reproduce the spontaneous-error tail is re-tuned or its matching gap is reported; the diagonal is only asserted on a decoy family that passes this match.
    (c) INDEPENDENT ENTRAPMENT as the non-circular corroborator. Entrapment items are built by DETERMINISTIC perturbation (in-genre cross-document swaps, numeric/temporal perturbation, explicit contradiction) -- constructed WITHOUT the generating LLM -- and provide a valid upper bound FDP_hat = N_E(1+1/r)/(N_T+N_E) that must agree with the decoy-FDR and with gold.

  DEMONSTRATED POWER (rigor fix). The review flagged that diagonal power may be marginal: certifying alpha=0.05 needs >=20 admissions (1/k floor) and the populability gate needs N_false_min=40 genuine false admissions pooled. Phase-0 MUST demonstrate both are reachable on the CLUTRR multi-hop family at the operative alpha* BEFORE the diagonal is asserted; if not, the (regenerable) CLUTRR confirmatory set is SCALED UP -- more documents and harder long-chain (large-k) splits that densify genuine errors -- until the power target is met or declared unreachable. The CERTIFIED-alpha grid is reported honestly: any alpha whose 1/k admission floor is not reached is dropped from the certified diagonal and reported as a precondition (NEVER as 'confirmed by conservatism').

  SCOPE / GOAL ALIGNMENT (scope fix). The goal targets ~3000-character professionally written legal/news/regulatory documents, upper-ontology (OpenCyc-style) grounding, and an LLM probabilistic-reasoning engine at fuzzy unifications. CLUTRR (synthetic ~355-char kinship) and Re-DocRED (Wikipedia prose) remain the CALIBRATION and STATISTICAL-OPERATIONAL anchors -- they buy crisp gold for the exact diagonal and human gold for the wedge -- but they are proxies, not the application. This iteration ADDS a genre-faithful OPERATIONAL DEMONSTRATION slice: ~15-30 genuine short professionally-written documents (legal/news/regulatory), on which we (i) ground argument types in a commodity upper-ontology slice (WordNet/ConceptNet/DBpedia-ontology standing in for OpenCyc) used ONLY for typing, (ii) run an explicit LLM probabilistic-reasoning step at fuzzy unifications, (iii) report the goal's HARD-REQUIRED quantified hallucination-reduction of decoy-gated extraction vs raw LLM generation, and (iv) export auditable trace-graphs whose leaves carry provenance + decoy + entrapment certificates. The application-faithful headline number lives here; the anchors grant it statistical validity.

  CLAIM CHAIN (each row independently testable; a break is localized and reported).
  | # | CLAIM | TEST | PASS CRITERION |
  |---|-------|------|----------------|
  | S0 | Score separation (precondition) | Phase-0: selected elicitation separates entailed vs non-entailed in the UPPER TAIL; isolated~batched agree on a labeled slice | tail-AUC>0.5 with CI; isolated~batched |
  | S1 | Decoy signature + spontaneous-error match (mechanism) | Tail-conditioned win-rate among above-cutoff matched pairs + upper-tail two-sample CDF test + decoy-vs-spontaneous-error tail CDF match | counterfactual decoys ~0.5; decoy tail ~ spontaneous-error tail; random swaps anti-conservative |
  | S2 | Calibration validity / the DIAGONAL (CLUTRR) | Sweep alpha; realized FDR vs crisp gold; document-block-bootstrap CI on the diagonal, on the populable family at demonstrated power | diagonal tracked within tau above the 1/k floor across the CERTIFIED grid |
  | S2b | Generator!=Scorer de-circularization (CLUTRR) | Re-run the diagonal with decoys from G scored by different-family S (and swap) on a labeled slice | diagonal survives G!=S, else reported as shared-model artifact |
  | S3 | Entrapment corroboration (non-circular) | Independent deterministically-built tail-matched entrapment; combined bound FDP_hat=N_E(1+1/r)/(N_T+N_E) | bound agrees with decoy-FDR and gold |
  | S4 | Operational wedge (Re-DocRED) | Matched-recall PR + hallucinated-conclusion rate vs PLAIN CONFIDENCE-THRESHOLD gate (primary zero-label comparator), CoT, RAG, labeled Mohri-Hashimoto conformal | decoy-gating beats plain thresholding at equal zero labels; competitive with labeled conformal |
  | S4b | Application-faithful hallucination reduction (professional docs) | On ~15-30 genuine short legal/news/regulatory docs: hallucinated-fact rate of decoy-gated extraction vs raw LLM generation; trace-graphs exported | quantified reduction reported with CI; trace-graphs auditable (goal hard requirement) |
  | S5 | Document-level predictive account (Re-DocRED) | Predict per-document tail-exchangeability gap; leave-one-cluster-out + leave-one-document-out CV; pre-registered GAP-regression power analysis | out-of-sample predictive IFF >= N_min held-out units; else DESCRIPTIVE |
  | S6 | Predictable propagation (preliminary) | Tightening alpha lowers multi-hop hallucinated-conclusion rate | direction + rough magnitude |

  BUDGET (unchanged ceiling). Isolated, provenance-blinded scoring is the default for the full confirmatory set; document-prefix prompt caching keeps the ~7-15M projected tokens to ~$1-3; the added professional-doc slice and the G!=S ablation slice add a small labeled increment. Cumulative LLM cost logged after every call; HARD STOP at $10. The budget waterfall is unchanged in ORDER but its first three priorities are now the three realized numbers above (diagonal, wedge, professional-doc hallucination reduction); S5/S6/floor-relaxation/rule-gating remain leftover-only.

  SCOPE OF CLAIMS. Facts AND bridges carry the headline. CLUTRR bridges are crisp and host the diagonal + the G!=S de-circularization; Re-DocRED bridges host the operational wedge and the predictive account; the professional-doc slice hosts the application-faithful hallucination-reduction headline. Defeasible bridges, ProbLog/isotonic, TDC-SB/UB and '+1'-floor relaxation, and S6 remain preliminary / if-budget-permits.
motivation: |-
  Text-to-logic pipelines stall at one crux: when strict symbolic unification fails, an LLM must fuzzy-match predicates and supply background knowledge, and that interface is exactly where hallucination re-enters and silently corrupts every downstream deduction. The dangerous hallucinations are not random nonsense but PLAUSIBLE, high-confidence false facts. Practitioners have no quantitative, label-free knob there: self-consistency and LLM-as-judge are heuristic; ontology-constraint filtering needs rich trusted constraints and catches only encoded violations; and the strongest uncertainty-quantification methods (conformal factuality, conformal selection + BH, multiple-testing hallucination detection, coherent factuality, and the newest online and differentiable variants) all need a LABELED calibration set and certify the final answer or claim set, not the neural-to-symbolic admission boundary.

  Genomics and proteomics solved an isomorphic label-poor problem -- selecting true signals among overwhelming noise with a guaranteed FDR and no ground truth -- via the knockoff filter and target-decoy competition, and learned the two ways the trick breaks: decoys 'too unrealistic to fool' the scorer make FDR optimistic (cured by property-matched decoys), and entrapment FDP must be estimated with a valid upper bound built INDEPENDENTLY of the decoys. We import matched decoys, the valid combined estimator, and construction-independence to the fuzzy-unification boundary, turning 'reduce hallucination' from a best-effort aspiration into a self-corroborated, label-free, auditable quantity with per-leaf certificates.

  The two-anchor design makes the value claim honest. A label-free FDR knob is worth building only if it is BOTH calibrated AND useful where plausible hallucinations actually bite. CLUTRR's closed kinship vocabulary is the right place to prove CALIBRATION (free crisp gold, exact realized FDR) but the wrong place to prove USEFULNESS (the relation set is tiny and well-known). Re-DocRED -- realistic Wikipedia prose, 96 open relation types, document-level multi-hop, human gold with evidence spans -- is the right place to prove operational usefulness, with a fixed shared extraction schema so the neuro-symbolic pipeline, a plain zero-label confidence threshold, CoT, RAG, and labeled conformal are all measured on the same triples at matched recall. The plain confidence threshold is the load-bearing comparator: it shows whether the decoy-competition machinery adds value over naive thresholding at the SAME zero-label budget, so the wedge cannot collapse to 'a threshold was enough.'

  Why it matters even at coarse alpha: NO existing label-free method offers ANY FDR knob at the fuzzy-unification interface. A first, auditable, zero-operation-label control -- even at alpha ~0.1 -- converts an uncontrolled hallucination channel into a tunable one. Because LLM decoys carry no theoretical guarantee, the most probable outcome is partial control; the Re-DocRED document-level predictive account (S5) converts a likely-partial result into a generalizable mechanism-level insight about WHEN the calibration holds.
assumptions:
- >-
  NULL SIGN-FLIP PROPERTY IS ENGINEERED AND TESTED, NOT GUARANTEED. knockoff+/TDC validity requires that, among genuinely-false
  candidates, sign(W_i) for W_i = score(real_i) - score(decoy_i) behaves like an independent fair coin conditional on |W_i|,
  with each false real and its matched decoy equally likely to receive any score in the high-score region near the cutoff.
  LLM counterfactual decoys carry no construction-level proof of this, so the claim is an empirically-validated calibration
  (not a theorem), tested IN THE TAIL via tail-conditioned win-rate ~0.5 plus an upper-tail two-sample CDF test.
- >-
  SCORE-DEPENDENCE IS HANDLED, NOT ASSUMED AWAY. Within-document correlation of LLM scoring noise is respected by treating
  the DOCUMENT as a block (document-block bootstrap for all FDP CIs; never i.i.d.-pooled signs). Batched-scoring contrast
  effects are removed by ISOLATED, provenance-blinded, order-randomized scoring as the default, with a pre-registered isolated-vs-batched
  check that doubles as the DISCRIMINATOR between a scoring artifact (isolation restores the diagonal) and genuine decoy non-exchangeability
  (anti-conservatism persists under isolation).
- >-
  THE SCORE-SEPARATION PRECONDITION IS PILOT-GATED. The LLM must emit a roughly monotone score separating document-entailed
  from non-entailed content better than chance SPECIFICALLY in the upper tail; verbalized confidence is documented to be overconfident
  there, so it is not assumed. A Phase-0 pilot selects the best elicitation (verbalized, logprob-derived, self-consistency,
  DINCO-style distractor-normalized), verifies tail separation, and confirms isolated~batched agreement on a labeled slice.
  The headline budget is released only on pilot success; otherwise the precondition-failure analysis is the reported result.
- >-
  THE CALIBRATION DIAGONAL NEEDS GENUINE FALSE ADMISSIONS, AND POPULABILITY IS MEASURED BEFORE IT IS ASSERTED. A realized-FDR-vs-alpha
  diagonal can only TRACK alpha if a meaningful fraction of admitted reals are genuinely false; on CLUTRR's easy closed vocabulary
  atomic facts may be too clean. Phase-0 measures, at the operative alpha*, the genuine false-admission count among CLUTRR
  proposals separately for atomic facts and multi-hop inferred kinship; the primary disconfirmation is pre-registered on whichever
  family reaches N_false_min (default 40 pooled; default expectation: multi-hop). The false-real pool is enriched by extractor
  over-generation and harder long-chain CLUTRR splits. Below N_false_min on all families, the diagonal is declared UNTESTABLE
  (not 'conservative, therefore confirmed'). CLUTRR gold is exact so the diagonal is asserted there; Re-DocRED gold has residual
  false negatives so only RELATIVE operational comparisons under shared gold are asserted there.
- >-
  S5 IS POWERED WHERE FEATURE VARIANCE EXISTS, WITH A PRE-REGISTERED PREDICTIVE-VS-DESCRIPTIVE THRESHOLD. The per-document
  tail-exchangeability gap can only be predicted if its input features vary; CLUTRR documents are near-homogeneous in entity
  density, specificity, and genre, so S5 is based on Re-DocRED (>=4 entity-type/topic clusters supply real cross-document
  variance). The S5 unit is the document nested in clusters, validated by leave-one-cluster-out and leave-one-document-out
  CV with a pre-registered GAP-regression power analysis; below a pre-registered minimum N_min of held-out units with sufficient
  admissions, S5 is reported DESCRIPTIVE, not predictive.
investigation_approach: |-
  Build the pipeline end to end, run a gating pilot first, then execute a strict BUDGET WATERFALL: Phase-0 pilot -> CLUTRR calibration diagonal -> Re-DocRED operational wedge -> (leftover only, gated on the two anchors clearing power thresholds) S5 / S6 / floor-relaxation / rule-gating. CPU-only; cumulative LLM cost logged after every call; HARD STOP at $10.

  FEASIBILITY (published before committing; see the budget arithmetic in the hypothesis). Isolated, provenance-blinded scoring is the default for 100% of the ~14.4K confirmatory scoring items; the ~7-15M projected tokens are kept to ~$1-3 by document-prefix prompt caching (the ~60 scoring calls per document re-use one cached document context at ~0.1x read cost). A sub-$0.30/M model is used; batching appears only in the labeled isolated-vs-batched sensitivity slice.

  PHASE 0 -- PILOT (precondition + powerability). On a few dozen labeled items per anchor: (i) select the elicitation that best separates entailed vs non-entailed IN THE UPPER TAIL; (ii) confirm isolated~batched agreement on a labeled slice (gate batching); (iii) MEASURE the genuine false-admission count among CLUTRR atomic-fact and multi-hop-bridge proposals at alpha* and choose the populable family for the primary disconfirmation (enrich via over-generation + long-chain splits if sparse); (iv) MEASURE on CLUTRR the cross-document variance of the S5 features (demonstrating CLUTRR's unsuitability for S5); (v) run a tail power analysis AND a GAP-regression power analysis for S5 on Re-DocRED. Size both corpora to target; gate the full run.

  PIPELINE. (1) EXTRACTION: a cheap OpenRouter LLM proposes typed first-order facts; argument types grounded in a commodity upper-ontology slice (WordNet/ConceptNet/DBpedia-ontology, standing in for OpenCyc) used ONLY for typing; the extractor OVER-GENERATES on CLUTRR to densify false positives. (2) DECOY GENERATION: PRIMARY family = document-conditioned counterfactual decoys (maximally-plausible, non-entailed facts/bridges); random type-matched swaps retained as the predicted-anti-conservative baseline; every decoy passes a non-entailment check with reported contamination. (3) ENTRAPMENT: independent, tail-matched, false-by-construction (in-genre cross-document swaps, numeric/temporal perturbation, explicit contradiction), mixed at reported ratio r, with its own tail-difficulty diagnostic. (4) SCORING: isolated, provenance-blinded, order-randomized, pilot-selected elicitation; rank-normalized per document. (5) FDR GATE: knockoff+ thresholding picks the most permissive cutoff with estimated corpus-aggregate FDR <= alpha, separately for facts and bridges and per anchor; admitted items enter the KB with a logged certificate. (6) VARIANCE/CIs: document-block bootstrap throughout. (7) ENTRAPMENT VALIDATION: combined estimator upper-bounds realized false-admission; compare against decoy-FDR and gold. (8) TAIL DIAGNOSTICS (measurement only): above-cutoff distribution vs gold false-reals + win-rate + upper-tail two-sample test. (9) REASONING: admitted facts/bridges populate SWI-Prolog for multi-hop deduction; backward-chaining proofs export as trace-graphs whose leaves carry provenance plus the decoy + entrapment certificate.

  SHARED OPERATIONAL EVALUATION (Re-DocRED). A single fixed claim-decomposition + relation-alignment step maps every system's output to (head, Re-DocRED-relation, tail) triples identically -- neuro-symbolic, plain confidence threshold, CoT, RAG, labeled conformal. Recall is matched by sweeping each system's own score to a common operating point; precision and hallucinated-conclusion rate are compared there with document-block-bootstrap CIs.

  EXPERIMENTS. (a) CLUTRR validity-of-control: sweep alpha; realized FDR via gold + entrapment bound on the populable family; diagonal tracking with block-bootstrap CIs; normalization and isolated-vs-batched sensitivity. (b) Decoy-family showdown + entrapment tail-difficulty. (c) Re-DocRED operational: matched-recall PR + hallucinated-conclusion rate vs PLAIN THRESHOLD (primary zero-label comparator), CoT, RAG, and labeled conformal, with guarantee status side by side. (d) [leftover only] S5 LOO-CV on Re-DocRED with the predictive-vs-descriptive threshold; S6 propagation; floor-relaxation; rule gating. (e) Cost check (<$10, CPU-only) + auditable trace-graphs.
success_criteria: |-
  PRECONDITION (gate). Phase-0 must show the selected score separates entailed from non-entailed content better than chance in the upper tail, isolated~batched agree, a CLUTRR family reaches N_false_min genuine false admissions, and the S5 power/variance measurements support a gap regression on Re-DocRED. If the pilot fails any gate, the reported contribution is the precondition-failure analysis.

  PRIMARY DISCONFIRMATION (single, S4/S5-independent). On the populable CLUTRR family (default: multi-hop inferred kinship) under isolated provenance-blinded scoring at alpha*: the central label-free control claim is DISCONFIRMED if realized corpus-aggregate FDR (vs crisp gold) exceeds alpha* by more than tolerance tau AND the document-block-bootstrap CI lies entirely on the anti-conservative side. If no family reaches N_false_min even after enrichment, the diagonal is reported UNTESTABLE (a precondition outcome), never as confirmed-by-conservatism.

  CONFIRMED requires ALL of: (1) CALIBRATION VALIDITY (CLUTRR) -- realized FDR tracks target alpha within tau above the 1/k floor across the demonstrable grid on the populable family, stable under the normalization and isolated-vs-batched checks; (2) DECOY SIGNATURE -- counterfactual decoys reach tail-conditioned win-rate ~0.5 and pass the upper-tail two-sample test while random swaps are measurably anti-conservative, and entrapment passes its tail-difficulty diagnostic with the combined-estimator bound agreeing with gold; (3) OPERATIONAL WEDGE (Re-DocRED) -- at matched recall (PR curves with block-bootstrap CIs), decoy-gating BEATS the plain confidence-threshold gate on atomic-fact precision and hallucinated-conclusion rate under identical zero labels, and stays competitive with the labeled Mohri-Hashimoto conformal reference. A BH multiplicity correction is applied across all validation tests.

  SECONDARY (reported only after the two anchors clear power thresholds; never escape hatches). (4) S5 document-level model: PREDICTIVE if validated out-of-sample across >= N_min held-out Re-DocRED units, else DESCRIPTIVE; either way it characterizes WHICH features govern tail-exchangeability. (5) Entrapment self-corroboration agrees with gold (co-failures reported). (6) S6 -- tightening alpha reduces multi-hop hallucination in the predicted direction. (7) Ablating the decoy gate measurably worsens hallucination. (8) The pipeline runs on commodity CPU within $10 with auditable trace-graphs carrying per-leaf certificates.

  DISCONFIRMED if: the primary disconfirmation fires (populable CLUTRR family anti-conservative beyond tau under isolated scoring); OR, separately for the operational claim, decoy-gating shows no precision/hallucination advantage over the PLAIN CONFIDENCE-THRESHOLD gate at matched recall on Re-DocRED (the wedge collapses to 'thresholding is enough'). An uninterpretable null -- control neither clearly holds nor clearly fails because the tail, the diagonal, or the gap test is underpowered -- is the true failure the Phase-0 power analysis (now including the false-admission base-rate measurement) is designed to prevent.

  for within-document sign dependence, and model where it holds.

  Property-matched decoy generation in cheminformatics/proteomics (DeepCoy, Bioinformatics 2021; protein-language-model decoys):
  generate decoys that reproduce the score properties of true positives so target-decoy FDR is well-calibrated. Difference:
  lives in molecular screening; we import the PRINCIPLE -- decoys must reproduce the false-positive score distribution, not
  be 'too easy' -- to design LLM fact/bridge decoys as document-conditioned counterfactuals.

  Tan, Xu, Bing et al., 'Revisiting DocRED -- Addressing the False Negative Problem in Relation Extraction' (EMNLP 2022; Re-DocRED).
  DocRED comprises 5,053 Wikipedia documents (distant-supervised from Wikidata), averaging 196.7 words and 19.5 entities,
  with 97 predefined relation types (96 real + no_relation) and human evidence sentences; Re-DocRED re-annotates 4,053 by
  adding missed triples (~13 F1 of headroom) and is public. We USE Re-DocRED as the open-vocabulary operational anchor (a
  fixed shared (head, relation, tail) extraction schema for ALL systems), asserting only RELATIVE operational comparisons
  (shared residual false negatives affect all methods equally), not the absolute FDR diagonal, which we assert on crisp-gold
  CLUTRR. Re-DocRED documents are SHORT (~200 words), which is strictly easier for commodity hardware; we treat document length
  itself as an S5 feature.

  2025): reconceptualizes hallucination detection as hypothesis testing, aggregates gray-box scores via conformal p-values,
  and applies general (dependence-tolerant) Benjamini-Hochberg/Yekutieli to control the false-alarm rate; it 'adds a lightweight
  calibration step that uses a small calibration set of non-hallucinated prompts to provide theoretical control', operating
  at the PROMPT/generation level. Difference: it is LABELED and certifies the generation; we are label-free for operation
  and gate the neuro-symbolic ADMISSION boundary via target-decoy competition with independent entrapment corroboration and
  per-leaf certificates. Its confirmed labeled-calibration requirement strengthens our label-free wedge.

  outcomes for finite-sample (m)FDR control, extended to online conformal selection via independent conformal p-values and
  feedback-driven model selection. Difference: it REQUIRES revealed labeled outcomes (feedback) and selects/certifies candidate
  outputs online; we control FDR with ZERO operation labels via decoy competition at the text-to-logic admission boundary,
  with symbolic propagation. The conformal-selection line reinforces -- not threatens -- the label-free wedge.

  2505.17126, ICLR 2025): represent reasoning outputs as dependency graphs and jointly validate claims with their logical
  ancestors; DCF makes the scorer differentiable to learn better scorers while recovering conformal guarantees. Difference:
  both require LABELED held-out calibration and certify OUTPUT claim graphs; we gate the neuro-symbolic ADMISSION boundary
  label-free via decoy competition, and our trace-graph is a Prolog proof with per-leaf decoy+entrapment certificates, not
  a conformally-validated claim DAG.

  vs our empirical calibration side by side; our wedge is label-free OPERATION measured against a plain zero-label threshold.

  Ontology-constraint hallucination filtering (ODKE+, Evontree, SHACL validation): reject LLM extractions violating trusted

  verbalized confidence. Difference: both yield a per-claim detection SCORE with no admission threshold, exchangeability,
  or competition argument; FactSelfCheck-style and DINCO-style signals are CANDIDATE elicitations in our Phase-0 pilot, while
  our novelty is the label-free FDR gate built on whichever elicitation wins.
inspiration: >-
  A Level-3 (methodological) cross-domain transfer. Genomics/proteomics solved the hardest label-poor problem -- deciding
  which of thousands of candidate signals are real with no ground truth -- with a guaranteed FDR via the knockoff filter (statistics)
  and target-decoy competition (mass spectrometry), and discovered the two ways the trick breaks: decoys 'too unrealistic
  to fool' the scorer make FDR optimistic (cured by property-matched decoys: DeepCoy, protein-LM decoys), and entrapment FDP
  must be estimated with a valid upper bound (Wen et al., Nature Methods 2025) using entrapment built unlike the decoys. We
  map all three onto the fuzzy-unification boundary of a text-to-logic pipeline, where the LLM aligns predicates and supplies
  background knowledge. Because the dangerous hallucinations are PLAUSIBLE high-confidence false facts, the decoys must be
  plausible counterfactuals from the LLM's own prior, exchangeability must be checked IN THE TAIL, and the FDR must be corroborated
  by independently-constructed tail-matched entrapment and arbitrated by a small gold probe. Three further moves come from
  taking the statistical machinery seriously on its own terms: (a) the knockoff null SIGN-FLIP property is named explicitly,
  and the two ways LLM scoring can break it -- within-document score correlation and batched-scoring contrast effects -- are
  handled by a document-block bootstrap and isolated provenance-blinded scoring, with the isolated-vs-batched check doubling
  as the discriminator between a scoring artifact and genuine non-exchangeability; (b) evaluation is split into a CALIBRATION
  anchor (CLUTRR, crisp free gold, exact diagonal -- with the disconfirmation pre-registered on the candidate family dense
  enough in genuine errors to be non-vacuous) and an OPERATIONAL anchor (Re-DocRED, open-vocabulary human gold, a fixed shared
  extraction schema for all systems, with a plain zero-label confidence threshold as the primary comparator so the wedge isolates
  the decoy machinery's value); (c) the document-level predictive account is based on Re-DocRED where the predicted features
  actually vary, with a pre-registered predictive-vs-descriptive threshold.
terms:
- term: Plausibility-matched (counterfactual) decoy
  definition: >-
    A synthetic candidate (fact or fuzzy-unification bridge) generated from the LLM's own prior over document-plausible-but-non-entailed
    content -- a document-conditioned counterfactual -- so its score distribution reproduces that of genuine plausible hallucinations.
    It replaces random type-matched swaps, which are 'too easy' and make the estimated FDR optimistic.
- term: Null sign-flip property (the validity condition)
  definition: >-
    The condition knockoff+/TDC FDR control rests on: among genuinely-false candidates, the sign of W_i = score(real_i) -
    score(decoy_i) behaves like an independent fair coin conditional on |W_i|. Two LLM-scoring channels can break it anti-conservatively
    -- within-document score correlation and batched-scoring contrast effects -- so the method tests and protects against
    both.
- term: Two-anchor evaluation (calibration vs operational)
  definition: >-
    CLUTRR (free, deterministic, crisp gold) hosts the CALIBRATION-VALIDITY claim (the realized-FDR-vs-alpha diagonal) and
    the single primary disconfirmation; Re-DocRED (human-annotated, open-vocabulary, document-level multi-hop) hosts the OPERATIONAL-USEFULNESS
    claim, the genuine schema-alignment bridge test, and the S5 predictive model. CLUTRR proves the knob is calibrated; Re-DocRED
    proves it is useful; the two are never conflated.
- term: Populability gate and false-real enrichment
  definition: >-
    A realized-FDR diagonal can only TRACK alpha if enough admitted reals are genuinely false. Phase-0 measures, at alpha*,
    the genuine false-admission count among CLUTRR atomic-fact and multi-hop-bridge proposals; the primary disconfirmation
    is pre-registered on whichever family reaches N_false_min (default 40 pooled). The false-real pool is enriched by extractor
    over-generation and harder long-chain splits. Below N_false_min on all families, the diagonal is declared UNTESTABLE,
    not confirmed-by-conservatism.
- term: Plain confidence-threshold baseline (the operational comparator)
  definition: >-
    A zero-label gate that admits candidates whose raw elicited confidence exceeds a swept threshold, with no decoy, no competition,
    no entrapment. It is the PRIMARY zero-label comparator in S4: if decoy-gating does not beat it at matched recall on precision
    and hallucinated-conclusion rate under identical labels, the operational wedge is disconfirmed (it reduces to 'thresholding
    is enough').
- term: Shared operational construct (Re-DocRED)
  definition: >-
    All systems target the SAME (head-entity, Re-DocRED-relation, tail-entity) triples over annotated entities, scored against
    human gold. A single fixed claim-decomposition + relation-alignment step maps every system's raw output -- neuro-symbolic,
    plain threshold, CoT, RAG, labeled conformal -- into this triple space identically, and recall is matched by sweeping
    each system's own score to a common operating point, so the comparison is apples-to-apples.
- term: Isolated provenance-blinded scoring
  definition: >-
    Each candidate (real, decoy, or entrapment) is scored in its OWN prompt with source/identity masked and presentation order
    randomized, instead of scoring many candidates jointly. This removes within-batch contrast/ranking effects that would
    let the model implicitly detect fabricated items and depress decoy scores. It is the default for 100% of the confirmatory
    set; document-prefix prompt caching keeps it affordable. The pre-registered isolated-vs-batched check discriminates a
    scoring artifact (isolation restores the diagonal) from genuine non-exchangeability (anti-conservatism persists).
- term: Document-prefix prompt caching
  definition: >-
    Because all ~60 isolated scoring calls for one document re-send the same document context, that prefix is cached once
    and re-read at ~0.1x cost per call. This is the mechanism that makes default isolated scoring fit the $10 budget (~$1-3
    projected) without reverting to batching, preserving the isolated-vs-batched discriminator.
- term: Document-block bootstrap
  definition: >-
    All FDP/FDR confidence intervals are computed by resampling whole DOCUMENTS (blocks), not individual candidates, so within-document
    correlation of LLM scoring noise is respected. This replaces the i.i.d.-pooled-sign variance the knockoff '+1' floor argument
    would otherwise assume, and yields the CI used in the primary disconfirmation.
- term: Tail-conditioned win-rate (tail diagnostic)
  definition: >-
    The win-rate of a decoy (or entrapment item) over a known-false real, computed ONLY among matched pairs scoring above
    the operative admission cutoff, reported with score CDFs and an upper-tail two-sample test. Target ~0.5 in the tail. Measurement
    only, never used by the gate; it supersedes the marginal win-rate, which can read 0.5 on average while a family is anti-conservative
    exactly where admissions occur.
- term: Combined / paired entrapment estimator and the ratio r
  definition: >-
    The valid entrapment upper bound on false-admission: FDP_hat = N_E(1+1/r)/(N_T+N_E), where N_T = admitted reals, N_E =
    admitted entrapment, r = entrapment-to-target ratio (reported; r=1 gives the tighter paired form). It replaces the flawed
    naive 'sample' ratio; r is propagated into variance and the achievable-alpha floor. Entrapment is built by a mechanism
    distinct from the decoys and gets its own tail-difficulty diagnostic.
- term: Single primary disconfirmation
  definition: >-
    One pre-registered, S4/S5-independent result that can falsify the headline: on the populable CLUTRR family under isolated
    provenance-blinded scoring at alpha*, if realized corpus-aggregate FDR exceeds alpha* by more than tolerance tau AND the
    document-block-bootstrap CI lies entirely on the anti-conservative side, the central label-free control claim is disconfirmed
    -- regardless of entrapment agreement or S5 outcome.
- term: Trace-graph
  definition: >-
    A human-auditable graph of the backward-chaining proof: nodes are sub-goals/derived facts, edges are rule applications,
    and each leaf carries its provenance (document span, ontology axiom, or admitted bridge) plus the decoy-competition and
    entrapment certificate that licensed it.
summary: >-
  Every LLM-proposed fact and fuzzy-unification bridge must out-score a plausibility-matched counterfactual decoy in a target-decoy
  / knockoff+ competition before entering a Prolog knowledge base, giving a label-free FDR knob at the neuro-symbolic admission
  boundary; calibration validity is proven on crisp-gold CLUTRR (with the single disconfirmation pre-registered on the error-dense,
  populable candidate family), operational hallucination-reduction is proven on open-vocabulary Re-DocRED against a plain
  zero-label confidence threshold and neural baselines on a shared extraction schema at matched recall, the gate is robustified
  against the two ways LLM scoring breaks the null sign-flip property (document-block bootstrap and isolated provenance-blinded
  scoring kept affordable by document-prefix caching), and a strict budget waterfall powers the two anchors before any secondary
  analysis.
_relation_rationale: >-
  Same gate mechanism and two-anchor frame; re-pointed from build to executing the diagonal and wedge.
_confidence_delta: decrease
_key_changes:
- >-
  STATUS UPDATE: marked the two anchors and two methodology specs as BUILT and reviewer-verified; the hypothesis now starts
  from a ready, validated pipeline and mandates EXECUTION rather than further building or planning.
- >-
  PRIMARY MANDATE: re-prioritized the contribution to the three realized numbers the iteration-1 paper lacked (diagonal, operational
  wedge, and the goal's hard-required quantified hallucination-reduction vs raw LLM) -- directly answering the decisive 'no
  empirical results' critique (score 3/10).
- >-
  CIRCULARITY (review methodology-major): added a pre-registered generator!=scorer ablation (different-family scorer) and
  a decoy-vs-spontaneous-extractor-error tail-CDF match; entrapment re-framed as the non-circular, deterministically-built
  corroborator. A diagonal that needs generator=scorer is reported as a shared-model artifact.
- >-
  SCOPE (review scope-major): added a genre-faithful operational slice of ~15-30 genuine short professional legal/news/regulatory
  documents with upper-ontology typing, an LLM probabilistic-reasoning step at fuzzy unifications, and auditable trace-graphs,
  to land the goal's application-faithful hallucination-reduction headline that CLUTRR/Re-DocRED proxies cannot carry.
- >-
  POWER (review rigor-major): converted the diagonal's power analysis into a hard Phase-0 precondition (>=20 admissions and
  >=40 false admissions) with mandatory scaling of the regenerable CLUTRR confirmatory set, and an honestly reported certified-alpha
  grid (drop alphas whose 1/k floor is unreached).
- >-
  CLARITY (review clarity-minor): fixed the two inconsistent W_i definitions to one canonical knockoff+ signed-max statistic;
  reserved the per-pair signed difference for tail diagnostics only; specified figure content (the diagonal and the matched-recall
  wedge with CIs).
- >-
  RIGOR (review rigor-minor): explicitly separated the finite-sample FDR GUARANTEE (under the unprovable sign-flip property,
  tested by the diagonal) from the document-block bootstrap (realized-FDP CIs + dependence diagnostic, NOT a restored guarantee).
- >-
  NOVELTY (review novelty-minor): sharpened the boundary against conformal selection (Jin-Candes), multiple-testing hallucination
  detection (Li et al.), Mohri-Hashimoto conformal factuality, and COCOCO -- the label-free + intermediate-admission-boundary
  distinction is the novelty wedge.

id: experiment_iter2_dir1
type: experiment
objective: >-
  Produce the HEADLINE calibration diagonal (realized FDR vs target alpha) and execute the single pre-registered primary disconfirmation
  on crisp-gold CLUTRR, accompanied by an explicit pre-run statistical power analysis (answering the power MAJOR) and independent
  entrapment corroboration (S0 + S2 + S3 + power).
approach: >-
  Implement the end-to-end gate exactly per the two specs [art_SLUbUUr6Ul98, art_K6AE23HoGqe6]. STAGE A (Phase-0 pilot, on
  the 40-example disjoint pilot slice): (i) select the label-free elicitation by tail-AUC with a bootstrap CI among the spec's
  shortlist -- verbalized confidence (floor), DINCO-style distractor-normalized, self-consistency/SelfCheckGPT, and a logprob
  yes/no-token score IF the model exposes non-null logprobs -- requiring tail-AUC>0.5 in the upper (admission) tail; confirm
  isolated~batched agreement on the labeled slice. (ii) Measure POPULABILITY: the count of GENUINE false admissions (vs crisp
  CLUTRR gold) among atomic-fact vs multi-hop-inferred-kinship proposals at the operative alpha*; pre-register the disconfirmation
  on whichever family reaches N_false_min=40 pooled (default expectation: multi-hop), enriching the false-real pool via extractor
  over-generation (T=0.7, n=3 samples unioned, cap 20 candidates/doc) and the dataset's harder long-chain k>=4 splits; if
  still marginal, POOL the atomic+multi-hop families to lift the admission count above the floor for tighter alpha (per the
  reviewer's suggestion), reporting the pooled-vs-separate sensitivity. (iii) Compute and REPORT the pre-run power calculation:
  given the measured false-admission rate, the within-document intra-class correlation, and B>=2000 document-block (cluster)
  bootstrap resamples, state which alpha in {0.05,0.10,0.20,0.30,0.50} clear the 1/k admission floor {20,10,5,4,2} and at
  what CI half-width; scale the regenerable CLUTRR confirmatory set (re-run data.py with more docs / harder splits) until
  the power target is met or declared unreachable. STAGE B (confirmatory diagonal): extraction over-generation -> document-conditioned
  counterfactual decoys with an isolated non-entailment check (log contamination rate, sweep the rejection threshold) -> ISOLATED
  provenance-blinded order-randomized scoring with document-prefix prompt caching -> knockoff+ gate using the CANONICAL competition
  statistic W_i = (Z_i v Z~_i)*sign(Z_i - Z~_i) (signed magnitude-max; the per-pair difference d_i = Z_i - Z~_i is reserved
  as a TAIL DIAGNOSTIC ONLY, never the gating statistic -- fixing the iteration-1 inconsistency) with admission threshold
  T=min{t: (1+#{W_i<=-t})/(#{W_i>=t} v 1)<=alpha}, separately for facts and bridges; sweep alpha and compute realized corpus-aggregate
  FDR vs crisp gold with document-block-bootstrap percentile CIs -- this IS the diagonal. Keep random type-matched swaps as
  the predicted-anti-conservative negative control. STAGE C (entrapment): build deterministically-constructed tail-matched
  entrapment WITHOUT the generating LLM (in-genre cross-document kinship swaps, numeric/temporal perturbation, explicit contradiction)
  at ratio r=1, compute the valid combined bound FDP_hat=N_E(1+1/r)/(N_T+N_E), and check agreement with the decoy-FDR and
  gold; attach a per-entrapment tail-difficulty diagnostic. Report the CERTIFIED-alpha grid honestly (drop any alpha whose
  1/k floor is unreached, labeling it a precondition, NEVER 'confirmed by conservatism'); evaluate the primary disconfirmation
  at alpha* with tolerance tau=0.05. Cleanly SEPARATE the two roles of the bootstrap (it quantifies FDP/FDR sampling variability)
  from validity-under-dependence (an empirical property established by the tail diagnostics + isolated-vs-batched discriminator),
  per the rigor MINOR. Use the spec's recommended openai/gpt-4.1-nano (logprobs+auto-caching, <$0.30/M); gradual scaling mini->full
  per aii-long-running-tasks; log cumulative LLM cost after EVERY call; soft cap ~$3 for this experiment, HARD STOP at $10.
  Output method_out.json with: the alpha-vs-realized-FDR diagonal arrays (figure-ready, with 1/k floor and CI bands marked),
  the power-analysis table, entrapment numbers, populability counts per family, and the disconfirmation verdict.

title: 'CLUTRR Crisp-Gold Calibration Anchor: Atomic + Multi-Hop Kinship Triples'
summary: |-
  Standardized, deterministic CLUTRR-derived dataset that serves as the CRISP-GOLD calibration anchor for the neuro-symbolic text-to-logic hallucination-control experiment. Source: CLUTRR v1 (Sinha et al., EMNLP 2019, arXiv:1908.06177), pooled TEST splits of configs gen_train234_test2to10 (1048 rows) and gen_train23_test2to10 (1146 rows), fetched as raw CSVs from the kliang5/CLUTRR_huggingface_dataset GitHub mirror and staged in temp/datasets/. CLUTRR is rule-based/templated, so its kinship gold is exact (no annotation noise) — exactly the property needed to host the realized-FDR-vs-alpha calibration diagonal.

  SCALE & SHAPE: ONE dataset group 'CLUTRR-v1-CrispGold-CalibrationAnchor' with 190 examples (row == one CLUTRR story). 150 confirmatory + 40 disjoint pilot (metadata_is_pilot). Stratified over chain length k=2..10 oversampling long chains (k>=4): confirmatory k-dist {k2:12,k3:15,k4:20,k5:20,k6:20,k7:18,k8:18,k9:15,k10:12}; pilot {k2:5,k3:5,k4:5,k5:5,k6:5,k7:5,k8:5,k9:3,k10:2}. Seed 20240617; selected ids recorded in top-level metadata for reproducibility.

  SCHEMA (aii-json exp_sel_data_out; validated, plus an independent 190/190 integrity pass): each example has STRING input and output (JSON-serialized; parse with json.loads) plus flat metadata_* fields. input keys: doc_id, document_text (clean prose, [Name] brackets stripped, native length never padded), document_text_bracketed (raw for entity-span provenance), entities[{name,gender,type='person',node_index}], query{head,tail}. output keys: atomic_facts[{head,relation,tail}] = the k directly-stated chain edges (the 'too clean' atomic family); multi_hop_facts[{head,relation,tail,derived_from,path_len,is_query_target}] = the k-1 proof_state-derived inferred relations incl. the query target (the error-dense 'populable' family the primary disconfirmation is pre-registered on); multi_hop_query_target{head,relation,tail}; kinship_edge_graph{nodes[{index,name,gender}],edges[{src,dst,relation}]}. All facts use the shared {head,relation,tail} triple structure with kinship relation strings (a Re-DocRED anchor could reuse the same structure with Wikidata relations).

  PER-EXAMPLE METADATA: metadata_fold ('k2'..'k10'), metadata_chain_length_k, metadata_difficulty_split ('short' k<=3 / 'long' k>=4), metadata_f_comb, metadata_task_name, metadata_source_config, metadata_source_split, metadata_clutrr_id, metadata_is_pilot, metadata_n_atomic_facts, metadata_n_multi_hop_facts, metadata_document_char_length, metadata_proof_state_raw, metadata_noisy_story, metadata_atomic_crosscheck ('match'), metadata_namemap_method ('genders_order'), metadata_genders_order_valid, metadata_relation_vocab_version ('clutrr_kinship'). Top-level metadata also carries relation_vocabulary (20 observed kinship relations), full k-distributions, and selected confirmatory/pilot id lists.

  CRISPNESS GUARANTEE: all gold is derived 100% from CLUTRR's own structured fields (proof_state leaf triples = atomic; proof_state dict keys = multi-hop) with NO homegrown rule reimplementation. Restricted to canonical simple-path chains (distinct entities==k+1, distinct edges, |atomic|==k, |multi_hop|==k-1, exactly one proof root equal to the query target, genders-order node->name map reproduces the proof_state atomic leaves); 1345 of 2191 pooled rows qualified, giving ample per-stratum supply.

  SELECTION: CLUTRR is THE chosen dataset (target_num_datasets=1). Secondary candidate ProofWriter (tasksource/proofwriter, kept in temp/datasets/ as backup) was excluded — it provides T/F/Unknown answers over rule/fact theories, not the kinship atomic+multi-hop triple gold this experiment is registered on. OUT OF SCOPE here (left to the experiment artifact): decoy/entrapment generation, LLM scoring, FDR/precision/recall, Prolog execution, transitive-closure enrichment.

title: 'Spec Sheet: Label-Free FDR Gate at the LLM Text-to-Logic Admission Boundary'
summary: >-
  Consolidated, source-traceable implementation spec for the label-free decoy-competition FDR gate that admits LLM-extracted
  facts/bridges into a Prolog/symbolic layer. Provides, for each component, a verbatim formula (with equation number and source),
  a symbol glossary, a language-agnostic pseudo-procedure, and a recommended default. KEY RESULTS: (A) knockoff+ admission
  threshold T=min{t: (1+#{W_i<=-t})/(#{W_i>=t} v 1)<=alpha} (Barber-Candes eq 1.9, exact FDR via Thm 2; plain knockoff eq
  1.8 controls only modified FDR Thm 1); the minimum-estimable-FDR floor is 1/k, so certifying FDR<=alpha needs k>=ceil(1/alpha)
  admissions -> demonstrable alpha grid {0.05,0.1,0.2,0.3,0.5} maps to k-floors {20,10,5,4,2}. Rajchert-Keich prove the '+1'
  is generally necessary (t=1 optimal), so keep it; TDC-SB/TDC-UB (bandsfdp) are an optional tighter FDX bound. (B) Entrapment

  r=1, tighter), lower bound N_E/(N_T+N_E) (failure-only), and 'sample' N_E(1/r)/N_T which is INVALID (biased). r=#entrapment/#target;
  default r=1 paired. (C) Document-block (cluster) bootstrap B>=2000 for all FDP/FDR CIs (resample whole documents; Cameron-Gelbach-Miller
  anchor) — the CI used by the primary disconfirmation. (D) Sole validity condition = Barber-Candes Lemma 1 (null W signs
  are i.i.d. fair coins) = TDC equal-chance; two anti-conservative failure modes (within-doc correlation -> bootstrap; batched
  contrast effect -> isolated provenance-blinded order-randomized scoring) and the isolated-vs-batched discriminator. (E)
  Property-matched document-conditioned COUNTERFACTUAL decoys + non-entailment verification (DeepCoy principle; DOE 0.166->0.032/0.109->0.038);
  random type-matched swaps kept as the anti-conservative negative control. (F) Ranked label-free upper-tail elicitation shortlist:
  DINCO (primary, overconfidence-corrected), FactSelfCheck (fact-level), self-consistency/SelfCheckGPT, logprob/yes-no-token
  (if exposed), verbalized (overconfident floor); Phase-0 selects on tail-AUC>0.5 with CI + isolated~batched agreement. (G)
  Recommended model openai/gpt-4.1-nano ($0.10/$0.40 per M, logprobs+auto-caching, <$0.30 input); fallbacks gpt-4o-mini then
  a logprob-free cheap caching model; projected cost ~$1-3 << $10 cap. (H) Novelty confirmed: no prior work applies knockoff/target-decoy/entrapment
  FDR at a label-free LLM text->logic admission boundary (conformal factuality/selection are labeled and certify outputs).
  Includes a final Parameter Defaults table and runtime follow-ups (probe logprobs non-null; confirm cached_tokens>0).

  Spec: Text-to-FOL-to-Prolog Pipeline and the Fair Re-DocRED Operational Comparison
summary: >-
  Implementation-ready specification (verbatim prompt templates, on-disk data formats, exact library APIs, mapping rules,
  ASCII pipeline diagram, library table, and data-format cheat-sheets) for the extraction-to-Prolog neuro-symbolic pipeline
  and the fair matched-recall operational comparison of the decoy-gating hypothesis. Block A: LLM text->typed-FOL FACT/BRIDGE
  extraction with deliberate over-generation in LINC (NLTK/Prover9 FOL, <PREMISES>/<EVALUATE> tags) and Logic-LM (Predicates:::/Facts/Rules>>>/Query)
  style; controlled-functor fact()/bridge() on-disk forms; over-generation prompts (T=0.7, n=3, cap 20/doc) and the candidate-record
  JSON schema with worked CLUTRR and Re-DocRED examples. Block B: SWI-Prolog-from-Python execution (janus-swi RECOMMENDED
  with exact query_once/query/consult/apply_once API; pyswip fallback; swipl subprocess safety net) plus a vanilla solve/2
  proof-tree meta-interpreter extended so each leaf carries provenance + decoy_certificate (W_i,T,q) + entrapment_certificate
  (FDP-hat,r), exported to JSON and Graphviz DOT with a 2-hop example. Block C: offline WordNet hypernym argument typing into
  {PER,LOC,ORG,TIME,NUM,MISC} with exact synset anchors, reusing Re-DocRED gold NER, ConceptNet/DBpedia optional. Block D
  (load-bearing): the Re-DocRED JSON schema and official (title,r,h_idx,t_idx) triple-matching metric, plus ONE fixed claim-decomposition
  + relation-alignment (MiniLM top-8 shortlist -> fixed temp-0 LLM pick among 96 P-codes or NO_RELATION) + three-tier entity-linking
  procedure that maps neuro-symbolic/plain-threshold/CoT/RAG/conformal outputs identically into the (head, P-code, tail) space,
  with a per-system matched-recall score sweep, a hallucinated-conclusion-rate definition for multi-hop deductions, and document-block-bootstrap
  CIs. Block E: RAG (BM25) and CoT extraction prompts, the plain zero-label confidence-threshold gate (primary foil), and
  the verbatim Mohri-Hashimoto conformal back-off Algorithm 1 plus its reusable sayless.py implementation (BREAKDOWN_PROMPT,
  frequency+gpt scoring, ceil-quantile calibration), explicitly positioned as the LABELED reference the label-free decoy wedge
  improves on. The decoy-gating core states the knockoff statistic and the knockoff+ data-dependent FDR threshold. Ten design
  decisions are resolved with fallbacks; a shared sub-$0.30/M OpenRouter model with prompt caching is recommended. 26 primary
  sources (papers + GitHub repos) cited; high confidence except the full 96-row rel_info.json and model-logprob availability.

<instructions>
YOUR ROLE: Write a detailed PLAN for the artifact. A separate executor agent runs the actual artifact later.

You are a PLANNER, not an executor. Your output is a plan that tells the executor what to do and how.
Do NOT execute the artifact itself — a separate agent handles that. Your job is to plan it so well that the executor can follow your plan step by step.

You CAN and SHOULD: search the web, read papers, and explore library docs to make your plan concrete.
You CANNOT run shell commands or scripts — code execution is disabled. Research via web tools only.

Do NOT do the executor's job: don't download datasets, don't implement code, don't run experiments, don't write proofs, don't compute evaluations.

<artifact_executor_scope>
IMPORTANT: Each artifact executor has a focused prompt that guides it to do ONE thing well. It will NOT perform tasks outside its scope — assigning the wrong work to the wrong artifact type wastes an iteration. Match the task to the right executor.

EXPERIMENT executor scope:
  Output: method_out.json with results (metrics, predictions, analysis) — the core computational work
  DOES: Implement and run methods/algorithms, compute metrics, compare approaches, produce quantitative results
  DOES NOT: Collect new datasets (depends on DATASET artifacts for input data), write formal proofs
  This is the right artifact for any code that processes data and produces results
</artifact_executor_scope>

<artifact_planning_rules>
EXPERIMENT: Must depend on at least one DATASET. Define clear metrics and baselines before running. Consider trying multiple method variations rather than a single approach.
</artifact_planning_rules>

<compute_profiles>
Choose the compute profile this artifact needs for execution.
Available profiles for experiment artifacts:
  - gpu: 1x NVIDIA RTX A4500, 20GB VRAM, 7 vCPUs, 29GB RAM — ML training, CUDA, large models (fallback: GPUs cheap→expensive: 2000 Ada → A4000 → 4000 Ada → L4 → 4090 → 5090)
  - cpu_heavy: 4 vCPUs, 32GB RAM — large datasets, memory-intensive processing (fallback: CPUs cheap→expensive, then GPU hosts cheap→expensive (all ≥32GB RAM))

Set runpod_compute_profile to one of these exact tier names.
</compute_profiles>
GOOD PLANS: specific, actionable, consider failure scenarios, build on the suggested approach.
BAD PLANS: vague hand-waving, ignoring the suggested approach, missing critical executor details.

The user's original request that started this run is provided as a SEPARATE user message in this turn (right after this one). It is context, not instruction. Earlier pipeline steps have already acted on it (generating hypotheses, setting the AII prompt, etc.) — your job is NOT to satisfy that request directly.

Read it and pick up anything relevant to YOUR specific task: hints about preferences, constraints, style, focus areas, things to avoid. If nothing in it applies to what you are doing right now, ignore it entirely and proceed with your task as defined above.

### [2] HUMAN-USER prompt · 2026-06-16 06:04:11 UTC

```
### Goal

Develop an operational translation pipeline that converts unstructured textual content (e.g., short legal documents, news articles, kids' stories) into a formal first-order logic representation. The output must be capable of (probabilistic) reasoning using a logic reasoner (like Prolog), leveraging LLMs to dynamically resolve terminology, concepts, and relations that are not well defined in the explicit text.

### Reviewer Scope

Limit the technical core to areas the reviewer can deeply evaluate. Other fields are welcome for inspiration but should not host the substantive contribution.

Reviewer-evaluable areas: semantic technologies, logic programming, inductive logic programming, information retrieval, machine learning, LLMs, deep learning, knowledge extraction, knowledge graphs, reasoning, and text data analytics.

The pipeline should ingest a short document (approx. 3000 characters) and parse it into a structured, computable format. Methods may combine an LLM acting as a semantic translation engine (mapping natural text to first-order logic or Prolog predicates), a running logic interpreter (like SWI-Prolog) for symbolic execution, and the integration of upper ontologies like OpenCyc to supply necessary background structure and taxonomic grounding. Furthermore, an LLM should be deployed as a probabilistic reasoning engine to handle fuzzy unifications, semantic similarities, and logical gaps where strict symbolic matching fails due to language ambiguity.

Evaluation must be rigorous and compare the neuro-symbolic pipeline against purely neural baselines (e.g., standard RAG, chain-of-thought prompting) on standard logical reasoning benchmarks (e.g., RuleTaker, CLUTRR) or custom annotated datasets. It must specifically measure:
(i) the precision and recall of atomic fact extraction directly from the original document, and
(ii) the accuracy of multi-hop fact extraction and logical deductions that require synthesizing explicit document facts with implicit common-sense knowledge.

Outputs must provide human-auditable trace-graphs of the reasoning steps to clearly demonstrate the logical path taken.

Constraints: The pipeline must be highly reproducible on any short, professionally written documents. Inference must be executable on commodity hardware, and the system must report a quantified reduction in hallucination rates compared to raw LLM generation.

### Publication

Target ACL Knowledge Extraction track as the primary venue, with EMNLP or specialized neuro-symbolic AI conference tracks (e.g., NeSy) as fallback targets.

### Things to Avoid

Avoid simplistic propositional logic translations of the text. Avoid purely neural black-box systems that lack interpretable reasoning traces. The substantive contribution must be an operational, hybrid method for reasoning with textual content that explicitly minimizes hallucinations.
